# Smooth Lines

### [Simple](https://silvman.github.io/smooth_lines/simple/)
Smoothing with distance delay. Line becomes more smooth in general, but there is still sharp edges where new point is inserted.

### [With Qurves](https://silvman.github.io/smooth_lines/with_qurves/)
Like the one above, but with quadratic bessie curves instead of lines. It helps to smooth sharp edges, but causes some artifacts when you are trying to draw a line that has sharp edges.

### [Smooth](https://silvman.github.io/smooth_lines/smooth/)
Compelitely different from two last methods, it separates the event proceeding and line drawing. Very smooth lines, but slow.

### [Grativation](https://silvman.github.io/smooth_lines/gravitation/)
Very similar to the one above. Now it's very easy to draw an ellipse, but...
